# Chilloutandplay

Hi, this is a personal project for a simple automation of playing videofiles. I wanted to be able to push a button to autoplay my medialibrary where i left off or something like that.

## Getting started

Instructions on getting a local copy running on your system.

## Prereq

1. Python
2. VLC

## Running

1. Clone the repo and install the prerequisites
2. Name the videofile Video1.WMV
3. Run VLC telnet interface -> `$ vlc -I telnet --telnet-password YOUR PASS`
4. Run the python script and it will autoplay Video1.WMV!

## Development

This is just a simple test of how to control VLC over telnet with python. It will be a part of my home automation systems, so there still remains some work.

## Demo
To be continued..
